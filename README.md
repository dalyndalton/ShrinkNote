# ShrinkNote
ShrinkNote is a simple program used to condense and clarify handwritten
notes.  The program optimizes pages of notes for computer displays by
grabbing a set of a few representative colors, and then building the
remaining image with that palette.

Shrinknote accepts most* image file types, but does not support reading from pdf.  If your copy machine
saves files as a pdf, i suggest using a conversion service like Cloudconvert to convert them into single image
files.

shows as not responding.  (If anyone wants to fix this, version 2.0 needs
